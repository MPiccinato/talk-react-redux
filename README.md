# Redux and React Talking Slides

This is a general purpose intro to React and Redux. There are a lot of great tutorials and great talks out there already, this is in fact builds up on a lot of those.

## Points

* What is React?
* Why React?
* One-way data flow
* React is an abstraction from the dom
* Component based
  * complex components manage their own state, send info down
* v = f(x)
* compelling? Declarative -> Predictable -> Confidence -> Reliability (Tom Occhino's ReactConf keynote)
* Other approaches? Angular, Vue
* React Ecosystem? Don't need em, but there are a few popular ones, creat-react-app, redux, SuperAgent, Fetch, Lodash
* Build Tools? Babel and Webpack

* Components === functions
  Just like functions, components take in parameters and return UI output. v = f(x)

* HTML, Javascript and CSS (JSS) all in one file
  * If code frequently changes together, it should stay together
  * Build components not templates
* JSX is syntax sugar for nested function calls, not required but helps composition and readability.

* Props and PropTypes
* Internal State
* Dom nodes with Refs
* Its just Javascript

* Redux state management
